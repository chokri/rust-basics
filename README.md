## Basics Rust
Hi there, I started learning Rust for a moment and I start with this repo to code basic functions and operations using Rust.
All along my learning I will push here with comments.

If you are familiar with Rust and you want to contribute, you can make an issue and I will try to resolve it in a PR.
This is a funny way to learn Rust I think.

Thanks to Rust community and specially Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols, for their contributions to the Rust Community by writing this PDF here [The Rust Programming Language](https://lise-henry.github.io/books/trpl2.pdf)
